# Share Links

This is in development, but will look to combine a lot of the pop-ups, dialogs, SDK and basics of share buttons that I tend to do in javascript.

### Bower Install

(coming soon, use git url for now)

### Angular Usage

`<script src="bower_components/share-links/js/ng-share-links.js"></script>`

```
<a href="http://domain.com/1/2/post.html" share-type="facebook" share-item="post.shareItem" class="button facebook">
  Share on Facebook
</a>
```

Share Item
```
{
	link: 'http://doma.in/sh0rt-c0d3',
	title: 'My Share Title',
	description: 'Short share description'
}
```

### Help

Just wait till I get a full implementation and copy some code snippets here
